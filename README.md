# Weather Application
An android application that shows current weather. This app is still a work on progress, it has two screens 
(CurrentWeather screen and Forecast screen) of the bottom navigation. Search screen and Setting screen are not yet implemented 

## What this app does
This application shows current weather of your current location.
It does that by using gps. By granting a permission it can access your current location and show current weather for that particular location.
It also shows the 7 days forecast of that location. 

## What is used in this app
This application is built using Jetpack Compose for UI.
It uses data from [open weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api) 
I use [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15736238-Weather-App-Design-Exploration) from dribbble
